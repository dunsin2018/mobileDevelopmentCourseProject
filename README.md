Mobil application is a course am currently studying as part of compulsory course work in partial fulfilment of my studies as a software development student. The course comes with few weekly assignment meant for individual students undergoing the program and also the MOBILE APPLICATION program comes with a final project work following the above guidelines:

# WHAT MY APP IS GOING TO BE AND WHY I AM CHOOSING IT

Am still in the process of finalizing the app i will be working on.

# TECHNOLOGY TO BE USED FOR MY PROJECT WORK

Sequel to the class lecture we the student has attended, i have critically looked at the flexibility of the technology that has been brought to our knowledge by the lecturer. i.e 

***** Andriod for the app (java)
***** Firebase for backend(for storage of data)

# PLANS FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS

***** Doing online visibility studies with friends and collegues on sharing my idea if its something they will like to have in the real world google playstores. This will enable me know the actual problem i will be solving as a mobil developer in the society.

***** Sourcing for extra material and resources that will help me come through in designing a reliable and sustainable application.

***** Consulting one or two experienced developers to vet my code if its standardized way of approach that is being used.
